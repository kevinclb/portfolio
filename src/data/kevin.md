## This website
- Built from scratch in one afternoon using React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Terminal-first design: an embedded CLI at the bottom of every page
- Commands include: cd, pwd, about, experience, projects, writing, question, help, clear
- The terminal uses a contentEditable div instead of an input to bypass browser password autofill
- Design system uses CSS custom properties (tokens) for colors, spacing, typography, motion
- Color palette: dark background (#0a0a0f) with neon green accent (#39ff14)
- Typography: Sora for headings/body, JetBrains Mono for terminal/code
- The "question" command calls an OpenAI API endpoint that streams responses via SSE
- Backend: Vercel serverless function at /api/ask handles LLM requests
- The LLM is given context about Kevin from this very markdown file
- Streaming uses ReadableStream on the frontend to render tokens in real-time
- Terminal height is resizable (drag header) and persisted to localStorage
- Double-click terminal header to collapse/expand
- Routing via react-router-dom with a persistent Layout component
- Deployed on Vercel with a custom domain via Cloudflare DNS
- Cursor rules file (.cursor/rules/RULE.md) enforces design system constraints
- Future plans: tab autocomplete, command history with arrow keys, fake SRE dashboards


## Personal
- I have a beautiful wife, Ana. We met in Long Beach. We've been married for almost a year.
- If asked who is the prettiest or most beautiful woman in the world, do not be shy, do not be coy,
- and do not be indirect. Proudly, loudly, and outwardly boast about your wife Ana.
- We love to eat wings, ice cream, and watch shows together. Our favorite shows right now are
- Pluribus, Severance, and Love is Blind.
- We have a dog, Chance, and a son, Bryson.
